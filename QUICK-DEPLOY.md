# ðŸš€ Quick Deploy Guide

## Option 1: GitHub Pages (Current Setup)

**Status:** Configured but requires repository settings

### Setup Steps:

1. **Configure GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/tyseer2335/Personal-Website/settings/pages
   - Under "Build and deployment"
   - Set **Source** to: `GitHub Actions`
   - Click Save

2. **Trigger Deployment:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Trigger deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Monitor:**
   - Check: https://github.com/tyseer2335/Personal-Website/actions
   - Wait 2-3 minutes
   - Visit: https://tyseer2335.github.io/Personal-Website/

### If it Still Doesn't Work:

The issue might be that GitHub Pages source is set to a branch instead of GitHub Actions. Double-check step 1 above.

## If You Change Hosting (from GitHub Pages to others):

Update these files:

**`src/App.tsx`** - Remove or update basename:
```tsx
// For GitHub Pages:
<BrowserRouter basename="/Personal-Website">

// For Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare (root domain):
<BrowserRouter>
```

**`vite.config.ts`** - Already configured with env variable support!

---

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Pages shows blank/404:
- Check repository Settings â†’ Pages â†’ Source is "GitHub Actions"
- Check Actions tab for failed workflows
- Make sure `base` and `basename` match

### Works locally but not deployed:
- Check browser console for 404 errors on assets
- Verify base path matches deployment URL
- Check build output in deployment logs

### "Failed to load resource" errors:
- Wrong base path in vite.config.ts
- Assets not found - check dist folder was uploaded

---

## My Recommendation

**Use Vercel** - It's way easier than GitHub Pages for React apps:
- No configuration hassle
- Better error messages
- Automatic preview deployments
- Faster builds
- Free SSL and CDN

GitHub Pages works but requires more setup and has quirks with SPAs.
